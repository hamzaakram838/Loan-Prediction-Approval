# Loan-Prediction-Approval
Implementing a few machine learning algorithms on a loan prediction dataset

The purpose of this project was to implement a few machine learning algortihms on a loan dataset to predict whether a customer will have their loan approved or denied

Out of the three models used the Random Forest was the best model as it had the best accuracy on the training and test dataset

Random forest accuracy on training data 0.97 
Random forest accuracy on test data 0.79

SVC accuracy on training data 0.82
SVC accuracy on test data 0.77

Logistic regression accuracy on the training data 0.82
Logistic regression accuracy on the test data 0.77

This project uses a Kaggle dataset which can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset 

It uses only the training dataset

It also uses some code to scale the data for the SVC which was from "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python A Guide for Data Scientists by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller, Sarah Guido"


This is also my first Github project
