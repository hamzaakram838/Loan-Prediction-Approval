# Loan-Prediction-Approval
Implementing a few machine learning algorithms on a loan prediction dataset

The purpose of this project was to implement a few machine learning algortihms on a loan dataset to predict whether a customer will have their loan approved or denied

This project uses a Kaggle dataset which can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset 
It uses only the training dataset

This is also my first Github project
